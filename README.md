Description

This project is a Python-based artificial intelligence assistant. It utilizes the Twilio API for sending and receiving WhatsApp messages and the OpenAI API for natural language processing and response generation. The assistant is capable of understanding text messages from users and responding in a coherent and context-aware manner.
Features

    WhatsApp Message Reception: Uses Twilio to receive messages from WhatsApp.
    Natural Language Processing: Employs the OpenAI API for understanding and responding to messages.
    Automated Responses: Generates automatic responses based on the context of the conversation.

Technologies Used

    Python
    FastAPI: For setting up a web server to handle HTTP requests.
    Twilio API: For WhatsApp message interactions.
    OpenAI API: For text generation and natural language processing.
